# Mangrove Population Growth Simulation

## Context
This project was done as part of an innovation project at Ecole Centrale de Lyon (France).
The project aims at planting mangrove forests in a temperate environment (France) since mangrove ecosystems have the highest carbon storage capacity out of any ecosystem.
The simulation part which is presented in this repository is done entirely by myself.

## Project
This project aims at planting A.Germinans mangroves in a temperate climate environment. A simulation was developed in order to have a general idea on the effectiveness of the method. Several relevant factors have been retained in order to make the simulation:
- A.Germinans' species specific properties
- competition between trees
- terrain properties (slope, salinity)
- number of cold events per year

The simulation is based on research findings by :
